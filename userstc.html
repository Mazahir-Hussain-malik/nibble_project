    Policy (“Cookie Policy”) is a part of and incorporated within and is to be
    read along with the Privacy Policy (“Policy”) and Term of Use. The
    capitalized terms used in this Cookie Policy, but not defined herein, shall
    have the meaning given to such terms in the Privacy Policy. WHAT ARE COOKIES
    AND LOCAL STORAGE? Cookies are small text files that are placed on your
    browser or device by websites, apps, online media, and advertisements. There
    are different types of cookies. Cookies served by the entity that operates
    the domain you are visiting are called “first party cookies.” So, cookies
    served by Nibble while you are on the Nibble Platform are first party
    cookies. Cookies served by companies that are not operating the domain you
    are visiting are called “third party cookies.” For eg., we may allow Google
    to set a cookie on your browser while you visit the Nibble Platform, and
    that would be a third party cookie. Cookies may also endure for different
    periods of time. “Session Cookies” only last only as long as your browser is
    open. These are deleted automatically once you close your browser. Other
    cookies are “persistent cookies” meaning that they survive after your
    browser is closed. For example, they may recognize your device when you
    re-open your browser and browse the internet again.“Pixel tags” (also called
    beacons or pixels) are small blocks of code installed on (or called by) a
    webpage, app, or advertisement which can retrieve certain information about
    your device and browser, including for example: device type, operating
    system, browser type and version, website visited, time of visit, referring
    website, IP address, and other similar information, including the small text
    file (the cookie) that uniquely identifies the device. Pixels provide the
    means by which third parties can set and read browser cookies from a domain
    that they do not themselves operate and collect information about visitors
    to that domain, typically with the permission of the domain owner. Local
    storage is a technology that allows a website or application to store
    information locally on your device. “Software Development Kits” (also called
    SDKs) function like pixels and cookies, but operate in the mobile app
    context where pixels and cookies cannot always function. The primary app
    developer can install pieces of code (the SDK) from partners in the app, and
    thereby allow the partner to collect certain information about user
    interaction with the app and information about the user device and network
    information. WHY DO WE USE THESE TECHNOLOGIES? We use cookies and other
    identification technologies for various purposes, including: authenticating
    users, store information about you (including on your device or in your
    browser cache) and your use of our Services and the Nibble Platform,
    remembering user preferences and settings, determining the popularity of
    content, delivering and measuring the effectiveness of advertising
    campaigns, analyzing site traffic and trends, and generally understanding
    the online behaviours and interests of people who interact with our
    Services. DO WE USE THIRD PARTY COOKIES? We use a number of suppliers that
    may also set cookies on your device on our behalf when you visit the Nibble
    Platform to allow them to deliver the services they are providing.When you
    visit the Nibble Platform you may receive cookies from third party websites
    or domains. More information about these cookies may be available on the
    relevant third party’s website. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THIRD PARTY
